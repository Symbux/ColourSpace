# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We follow [semver](https://semver.org/).

Once the library hits a full V1 release, then each major version will get security updates for 1 year from the release date.

Security releases are pushed out as patches, and we would expect that you keep up to date with minor and patch versions, only major versions _may_ include breaking changes.

We shall note 

| Version | Supported          | Notes |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| 0.X.X   | :x:                | Alpha |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Not Released |
